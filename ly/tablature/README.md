# Tablature

The *Tablature* library is a collection of modules which provide features not
currently supported upstream by LilyPond.  While some of these features
might not be specific of tablatures or instruments like guitar, bass, etc.,
the name Tablature seemed to be the best comprehensive term in most cases.
Below you can read about the available modules.

## Microtones

On a fretted instrument, like guitar (in standard tuning), there are no frets
for microtones, but there are two cases where microtones in tablature
are needed:

- when the tuning contains a microtone
- when a string is bended to produce a microtone

As LilyPond supports microtones in tablature since
[version 2.19.31](https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/4643/),
this module should be used only to compile files written for earlier versions.

## String bending

LilyPond doesn't support guitar string bending yet.  This snippet
contains a Scheme file which provides some basic features.  It was
written by Marc Hohl in 2009.

There are currently two open issues in the tracker:

- [issue 3700](https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/3700/)
  aims at integrating the guitar bending written by Marc in Scheme
  in the LilyPond codebase.
- [issue 1196](https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/1196/)
  is about adding a new bend engraver, which is the ultimate goal.


### Limitations

- Line breaks over bending notes are not supported and they are currently
  disabled, because otherwise the file would not compile as soon as page
  formatting decisions create such a situation.
- You can't use hammer-on and pull-off when `\bendOn` is active, because
  this snippet uses and transforms the slur engraver.  This implies that
  you cannot, for instance, start a pull-off right after a bend release.
  This is one of the reasons why a bend engraver is needed (see
  issue 1196 above). However, you can work around this problem by adding
  an hidden grace note  where the pull-off should start; you may have to
  use the `\shape` command to adjust the slur shape.
- If you use Staff and TabStaff, you may have to add some more padding
  in order to avoid collisions between the bending interval number and
  the staff:
  ```
  \layout {
    \context {
      \StaffGroup
      \override StaffGrouper.staff-staff-spacing.padding = #5
    }
  }
  ```


### Usage

You can activate and deactivate the bending with the following commands:

    % music...
    \bendOn
    % bended notes here
    \bendOff

> Remember to put the music in Voice or TabVoice contexts (not just Staff
> or TabStaff), otherwise you may get an extra staff, as explained in the
> [Usage manual](http://lilypond.org/doc/stable/Documentation/usage/common-errors.html#an-extra-staff-appears).

Within these commands, the parentheses, normally used to notate slurs,
will notate the bendings.  You can write any bending from a quarter
tone up to any interval (a number over the bending arrow will show
the interval):

    d8( dih)
    d8( dis)
    d8( e)
    d8( f)

Bend and release requires the use of a closing parenthesis to close the
bending and a new opening one to start the release:

    d8( e)( d)

Pre-bends - when string is bent before plucking it - are supported
through the `\bendGrace` command and two different \preBend commands:

    \bendGrace { \preBendHold c8( } d2)  r2
    \bendGrace { \preBendRelease c8( d)( } c2)  r2

`\preBendHold` is a simple pre-bend, while `\preBendRelease` allows to
release the bending.

Finally, there are two commands that control how a bending behaves
along the time.  `\bendHold` allows to hold a bend for a longer time
by using ties:

    d8( \holdBend e) ~ e2( d)

`\shiftBend` allows to bend a string in two steps:

    c4( \shiftBend d)( e2)
